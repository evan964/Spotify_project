Evan Azoulay & Oded Salton

We both found a common field of interest with music , Evan is a talented musician and
Oded is talented listener , therefore we have decided to use spotify dataset in order to
discover how to identify what are the features that affect the quality music that we listen to .
Our dataset in general is provided by Spotify API service that allows us to access songs
features of archive of millions of song such as : Tempo , Danceability , Acousticness ,Energy
etc ..
The biggest question that we had liked to receive an answer for is whether a song
popularity can be predicted according to those features or it doesn’t have any strong
connection to those features.


### Data set name – 19,000 Spotify songs. (we will use both data and info)
Description:

Spotify, which featured with 18 numeric features such as (popularity – discrete, danceability,
energetic – continues and playlist – categorical). The data is unsupervised data (there isn’t any
targeted data. The data is answering to the constraints of the assignment
