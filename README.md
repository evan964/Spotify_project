Evan Azoulay & Oded Salton

We both found a common field of interest with music , Evan is a talented musician and
Oded is talented listener , therefore we have decided to use spotify dataset in order to
discover how to identify what are the features that affect the quality music that we listen to .
Our dataset in general is provided by Spotify API service that allows us to access songs
features of archive of millions of song such as : Tempo , Danceability , Acousticness ,Energy
etc ..
The biggest question that we had liked to receive an answer for is whether a song
popularity can be predicted according to those features or it doesnâ€™t have any strong
connection to those features.
